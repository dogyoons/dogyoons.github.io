## Course Structure and Evaluation
The students’ performance in this course will be evaluated based on the following:
* Homework: 30%
* Midterms: 30%
* Final exam: 40%
* Participation: up to 3% extra

### Homework
There will be six homework assignments in total, not counting the preparatory ``Homework 0'' that you do not need to submit. 
You will have one week to complete each assignment. 
The lowest homework score will be dropped, so your final grade for the homework component is based on your five highest homework scores. 
For more details about submission requirements, late submission policy, etc., please see the syllabus.

### Midterms
There will be two midterms that will be held in class, during the scheduled class times:
* Midterm exam 1: Friday, April 25, 2025, 12:10-1:00 PM (Wellman Hall 26)
* Midterm exam 2: Friday, May 16, 2025, 12:10-1:00 PM (Wellman Hall 26)
The lower score of the two midterms will be dropped. 
There will be no make-up exams. 
If you must miss an exam due to illness, travel, or any other reasons, this exam will be the one to be dropped. 

### Final exam
The final exam will take place at the designated time noted above (Friday June 6 at 1:00 PM) at the usual classroom (WELLMN 26). 
There will be no make-up exam. 
However, if you have another final exam starting or ending 30 minutes before or after the scheduled time, you may present documentation and request to start 15 minutes earlier or later. 
To request this accommodation, the student must contact the instructor at least two weeks in advance for the request to be processed.

### Participation
Students may earn up to three bonus points through active participation. 
Of the three total bonus points:
* **Up to two points** will be awarded at the instructor's discretion, based on overall participation and engagement in lectures. 
To qualify for **at least one** of these extra points, you must contribute to a class discussion **in person** during a lecture (not in discussion sessions) at least once during the quarter. 
* **Up to one** point will be awarded by the TA’s recommendation, based on participation in discussion sessions and TA office hours.
