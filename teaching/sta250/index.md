## Topics
We will cover the following subjects, which may change due to time constraints or student interests.
* Intro to supervised learning and generalization theory
* Optimization theory and methods
* Deep learning theory
* Brief survey of additional topics (if time permits)
  - Causal machine learning
  - Deep generative models
  - ...


## Course Structure and Evaluation
The first ~7 weeks of the course will consist of lectures, in-class quizzes, and in-class reading group discussions. The following ~2 weeks will survey additional topics, and the last week of the coursae will be for presenting final projects.

The students' performance in this course will be evaluated based on the following:
* Homework: 30\%
* In-class mini-quizzes: 5\%
* [Reading group discussions](/teaching/sta250/paper-reading/): 25\%
* [Term project](/teaching/sta250/project/): 40\%
