My research interests broadly lie at the interface of optimization, statistics, and machine learning, with a focus on developing theories and efficient algorithms for data-assisted decision making.  I am especially interested in geometric properties that can explain the outstanding performance of modern machine learning and AI technologies, aiming to enhance the systems utilizing these advancements. Currently, my efforts focus on

* Geometry of high-dimensional statistics and learning
  - Geometry of regularized M-estimation
  - Utilities and limitations of low-complexity models

* Mechanistic properties of overparameterized ML models
  - Scaling laws

* Decision making with high-dimensional data \& ML models
  - Causal inference in high-dimensional settings
