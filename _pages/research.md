My research interests ㅣie at the interface of optimization, statistics, and machine learning, with a focus on developing theories and efficient algorithms for data-assisted decision making.  I am especially interested in uncovering the geometric principles that govern low-complexity models in high-dimensional settings and exploring how these insights can explain the outstanding performance of modern machine learning and AI technologies, and advance decision-making tasks.
Currently, my efforts focus on

* Geometry of low-complexity models for high-dimensional statistics and learning
  - Identifying structural patterns and geometric properties in data-driven models
  - Building efficient computational frameworks for leveraging these structures
  - Establishing theoretical limits and performance guarantees

* Decision making with high-dimensional data
  - Designing predictive strategies with noisy or non-Euclidean data
  - Causal inference with overparameterized models

* Machine learning/Deep learning theory
  - General machine learning theory
  - Science of deep learning: training dynamics, scaling laws, …
  - Any topics related to understanding deep learning models
