## About
I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.ucdavis.edu/) at University of California, Davis.

Prior to joining UC Davis, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Michigan, hosted by [Alfred O. Hero](https://hero.engin.umich.edu/) and [Qing Qu](https://qingqu.engin.umich.edu/).  I completed my Ph.D. in [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/) at MIT, advised by [Pablo A. Parrilo](https://www.mit.edu/~parrilo/) and [Devavrat Shah](https://devavrat.mit.edu/).  Also, I earned my undergraduate degrees from Seoul National University in South Korea.

My research interests broadly lie at the interface of optimization, statistics, and machine learning, with a focus on developing theories and efficient algorithms for data-assisted decision making.  I am especially interested in studying the geometric principles that govern low-complexity models in high-dimensional settings, aiming to explain the performance of modern AI systems and advance decision-making tasks. Specifically, my current interests include:
* Geometry of low-complexity models
* Decision making with high-dimensional data
* Machine learning & Deep learning theory
