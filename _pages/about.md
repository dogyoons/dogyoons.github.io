### About
I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.ucdavis.edu/) at University of California, Davis.

Prior to joining UC Davis, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Michigan, hosted by [Alfred O. Hero](https://hero.engin.umich.edu/) and [Qing Qu](https://qingqu.engin.umich.edu/).  I completed my Ph.D. in [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/) at MIT, advised by [Pablo A. Parrilo](https://www.mit.edu/~parrilo/) and [Devavrat Shah](https://devavrat.mit.edu/).  Also, I earned my undergraduate degrees from Seoul National University in South Korea.

My research interests broadly lie at the interface of optimization, statistics, and machine learning, with a focus on developing theories and efficient algorithms for data-assisted decision making.  I am especially interested in geometric properties that can explain the outstanding performance of modern machine learning and AI technologies, aiming to enhance the systems utilizing these advancements.
